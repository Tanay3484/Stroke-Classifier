# Stroke-Classifier
This project uses the Stroke Prediction dataset from kaggle ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)) to predict if a person 
has a risk of a stroke based on their lifestyles.

The model uses a Feed Forward Neural Network Classifier using Tensorflow.

The final model accuracy achieved was 72%.
